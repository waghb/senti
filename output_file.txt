Glorifying the ordinary business man.. to hide Modi adani scam.
Adani ports mein drugs pakda tha 3300 kg ka ye kise ko yaad hai ya nahi  ???  21 hajar crore ke drugs mile waha se....  
Drugs ki smuggling, selling hoti hai waha or Gujrat mein unke mitra  bjp ki sarkar hai isliye ye mamla chupa diya gaya..  na police , c.b.i. ki jaanch huvi na media pohoch paye waha.  Jahir se baat hai joh insaan duniya ke sabse bade drug diller pablo Escobar se bhi jada drugs sell karta ho voh amir toh hoga hi....
he is just a broker in between in many business like airports etc..its actually again managed by foreign companies. He isn't creating any big job opportunities like TATA or infosys. This Modi and team collects huge huge money from many other businessmen and companies, transfers it to shell companies in Mauritius and through those companies invest that money in Adani group and even pump its shares artificially. Upon that the Modi government highly favor's most of big projects to adani group. Adani didn't create any kind of technology disruption like bill gates or atleast like a any startups like zomato or uber...He is just a broker and agent of Modi team putting a mask of big industrialist in india.
Gautam adani and NaMo are best friends

Adani in youngester look like nawaziddin siddique😂😂
Great narrative! Superb.
Hii
Adani's exact business strategies 🤔 : 

1) Start a business, and find more businesses that will support or fulfill all that one business needs.

2) Have a stronger political connections so as to minimize the competition.
Bhai data ko analysis karo.. story mat banao khudh se
Adani ne paise ki liye jitna pap kiya he uske ke liye 20 saal ki antar uska chamri nikal dunga waada he mera

Palanpur is 750km from mumbai , do proper research bro 😂
पूर्णतः पक्षपात पूर्ण विश्लेषण है, ये। इस यूट्यूब चैनल ने जिस किताब के आधार पर अडानी के शुरुआती व्यापार के बारे में तथा गुजरात में उद्योगपति के रूप में स्थापित होने के संदर्भ में जो तथ्य प्रस्तुत किये हैं उस किताब का लेखक स्वयं में ही संदिग्ध है। यह उस लेखक ने स्वयं ही स्वीकार किया है।

Adani is the financial operator for Modi and BJP. In layman term.
This video has many wrong information. You should check your video before uploading.
Money transaction batau yaar kese kiya kiya  , kiyuki normally apke pass crores kha blueprint bhi ho firbhi koi politician apko help nahi karge us dauran kese dell mujee Janna hain ,  kiyuki jitna pata hain Adani ke pass starting mein itna capital Aya kahase
Hi SIR JI ....please make a video on city Limouzine and City' Realcom scam, both the companies are under liquidation since 2009. No solution to scattered personal till now. Pl make a detailed video on this topic.
It is very good to see, you collect lot of info. 
But, In Youtube no one talk about ADANI's 0 to 1 step...
उस लड़के ने मोदी जी से कहा था। मोदी जी उसको उसी वक्त गरम चाय पिलाई थी।
Bhai Ye Video Dekhke paka he ki aapki soch iss bar bikgayi paysa Mila he bhai Mota adani se apko
Adani is a example of Monopoly in business.
For those who are thinking that politicians helped Adani but I think it like Adani has guts, vision and courage to do things not everybody can become Adani.
We respects our army, farmers, teachers and scientists but we failed to respect our businessmen.
13:24 wait, sez are made my govt right? How can adani do that?
Thankyou for such an informative and intriguing video
My hometown is Lucknow and I have seen the airport development after Adani's charge. It has been immense. He has even expanded the Lucknow Airport and has also bought new land near to Lucknow, and you haven't spoke about the arteleries plant which is coming up by Adani group. And, very soon he will start supplying it to Indian Army.
He Earned Money By telling "how someone earned "

Motabhai bahut smart he
Adani is not an upright business he is a crook, who used the politics to change policy to favour him to build his empire. Black money was bought from abroad to invest on india. Shame on people who think he is a great example for our society.
He is genius read his book u will know also he is disrespected coz he is first generation billionare

The Indian Market is not under anyone’s monopoly, Adani does face competition namely Tata and Ambani its likely a oligopoly, hence we need not worry
Modi he to mumkin he

Why all ports sre blurred ?
Wahh bhai mast promotion kar rehe ho …
I think you're also supporter of adani, what about middle class people who are facing bad impact bcoz of adani
Well done , a lot of hardwork might be done in creating this video !
Upper caste leader and their corruption leads to this
People call him 'Modi'
Adani call him 'Moti' (his pet 🐕)
Modi is puppet of adani !

Hi Mohak, this video is like reading a book! Thanks
Modi h to mumkin. H
Sorry Mohaak bhai . This time i will disagree with your opinions . 

Yes . What you have said about " guided Capitalism " of S.korea is 100% correct . Even i will stand by that .

But i prefer the Taiwanese model . Their growths model of investing in many companies small or medium companies is the way forward . That means not giving all of govt's importance to just 2-3 companies but to give importance to nearly all of the companies and all sectors .

S.Korea guided growth  model will only give rise to " chaebols " aka Conglomerates which will own nearly everything in the market  and will even blackmail the govt to favour them . Already things are bad here and in South Korea it's a shit show .

Better to emulate Taiwan or Germany that S.korea .

S.korea is a hyper capitalism country on steroids . 

I don't want that type of business and working  environment here in India
😂😂 rahul se paysa udhar liya hai na tum 😂😂😂

The company will crumble when the present govt change. Until then while the BJP is in power and Modi is the PM, adani will not fall. If adani falls, BJP will fall, when BJP falls, adani will fall. That is their relationship.
Adani  was already rich, when he had a brother who needed 20 metric tons in his factory in 1985 that means they were uber rich. My Dad was earning a salary of 1000 rupees at that time like majority of India was doing.
South Korea also has inheritence tax, should we have that too?
Tax evasion💀💀💀
Adani should be protected 😊

Agreed Every Big business works on the fundamental of "power to power push", difference in India is its very dirty, people dont understand that monopoly in business is the biggest cause of major Finacial problems nationwide, beside what can you expect from a population where 98% of people earns less then 50K a month.
Make more such videos love to hear history to future

Instead of national champions govt can follow favouritism by favouring Indian companies over other countries firms in a given market
am i the only one who thinks that young adani looked like nawazuddin siddiqui?
Crony capitalism is like advanced corruption. Adani business gets promoted by govt, Adani doesn't pay sufficient taxes, thereby killing other younger businesses, and reducing the tax money that could benefit citizens. The result is cruel, unquestioned exploitation and corruption. Now, if you are unlucky enough, the politicians who benefit from this also have evil goals. It is a trap, and once in it, it is nearly impossible to come out of. Well played!
Sad to.see. that Mohak - Soch is also turning into a BJP influencer.. he is doing it intelligently , slowly trying to improve the perception of BJP amongst masses ... Another Star fallen... Another one sold his soul to the power ...
Adanis biggest vertical integration is the political network he has created!
Hindenburg fraud, adani always brightest.
SAB MODI KI BAJAH SE
If you check his tax payments records  then you will be surprised to know how much tax money your government is losing every.
In Short : तुम मुझे चंदा दो, मैं तुम्हें धंधा दूंगा  😂
Bhai paisa ho toh kya kuch nai ho skta.

Adani be like: 2024 ke election ke bad paisa hi paisa hoga😂
How muche they pay tax and how much they relif from bank we need that detail....

Mark my words . After 10-15 years this Adani bubble will burst and our GDP will fall down to 2-3 percent..Just because of this Capitalism..

After hearing the complete story - im now convinced- all politicians are involved in Adani business! Did u notice how all rules got changed or introduced exactly at the time when Adani needed it. If this guy one day crashes -

Hello, Mohak sir , there are some regional TV & YouTube channels have been promoting hate in the community for the past year, and people have been believing them without question, which has intensified more hate. One such channel is called "TV Vikrama" in Kannada. Personally, I ask that you either do a separate video on these kinds of regional channels  or at least include them in your upcoming videos. Regards.

Modi ka paisa hai
Why do I feel your video normalizing these kind of capitalist who break law and make money and give very little back to the society that gives them the riches
Big correction = adani group is not owned by Adani , he is just an binami , the real owner is an double engine
I would have been really proud of adani if:

1. He didn’t steal from his own companies and cheat his investors/shareholders 

2. Didn’t create shell companies to buy up a combined 90% of his companies shares against government regulations to prop up his net worth 

3. Didn’t use political power to acquire India’s strategic assets like ports, airports,….. at premium discounts.
There are so many corrections in this video. Looks like soch has dropped its research quality.
Ultron was right when he said " BANAO DOST AUR DUSHMAN KO DHANWAN...TB HOGI ASLI KI PEHCHAAN "
You can thank modi ji and other politicians for the looting through adani
Rahul Gandhi jindabad ❤❤
Rahul lao ❤❤
Modi bhagao 🎉🎉
It's intresting everytime you talk about something negative about the current government or adani you also bring in old examples of congress to somewhat justify behaviour. "Koi nayee baat nahi hai" its important to criticize present, its useless to bring things in past that were done wrong we all want better things don't we?
Ab aappe ed or cbi ka red parega😂
History will remember the friendship of Modani 😢😂
Modi jaise dost adani jaise har indians ko mile😂
Kandla is such an old big shipyard that Adani was not even established at that time.
Narendra Modi is a whole sole responsible for Gautam Adani's booming success.

Hindenberg summed his business perfectly. That exactly is his model for all business. Eg… in early 2000 he scammed nearly 1000 cr with fake export of diamonds.

As a Odoo expert I'm happy for its advertisement. 😊
Majority of viewers can't afford LPG gas line in their home And they interested in how adani got billionaire......😂😂
Sab banane ke baad adani ji ko ek country chahiye rahegi fir modiji India ko bech denge adani ko
adani is not inventing and manufacturing like samsung, he is just behaving like parasite and taking resources
Takleef hua hai bolne de 😂
Bhai merko bhai 50 paise per acre dedo... Aur mooooodi jaisa agent 😂 ek raat top 1 AAjaunga.... Skipped the video coz i know what all garbage thy gonna feed supporting modi and Adani
The saplings were planted and grew so much under congress era
And still some chamchas blame/give credits to BJP for these businessmen
Such Desi legends should be aspiration for all our youths instead of IAS IPS and foreign expats
😂 most of the people are just jealous in the comments... You can't achieve something so just curse the one who has achieved. 
The are the traits of jobless & jealous people who can't think big and can't achieve something in their life. They only depend on goverment to give them freebies to survive. These people don't contribute to country's betterment but only criticise anything they can.

Adani is sucking the country and the future of our next generation ---- the earlier we realize is better for us ....
Government jad apni marji te aa jave tah kabja ve kar lendi ....kon adani ha kon ambani 😅😅😅😅.
Its all because of modi favor as CM and pm ..its as looted govt property ..nothing else example airport contract ,sea port , solar panel ..this is know ..its tragedy ..govt property belongs to public is looted and public is made to pay extra tax
We need to respect wealth creators ..leave aside this crony capitalism nonsense
Modani
Too guts needed to make these type of videos ❤ . Salute to mohak sir .
29
India richest person but only 5000 jobs given total. This is jobless growth.
Thanks for making such a nicely rounded video Mohak ! As a 2nd Gen entrepreneur, I truly believe that a healthy competition among the companies in the market shall be promoted instead of just one company to ensure sustainable growth of the country.
Best decision: Leaving college. Rot learning would have destroyed his bold decision making capacity and would have made him a timid person.
Mr Mohak adani ko clean chit di hai Supreme Court ne he is free from all the acquisitions made by hindenberg and after US media reported a news that Hindenberg made false accusations then its stocks bounced backed.
Adani is the modern day suniel shetty from dhadkan
Adani❌ modi manager✅
Adani wasn't idea and any pre experience about how to handle the business of Airports handleing, still the time being i won't understand that how and why AAI (Airport Authority of India) why gave all of the important Airports to the inexperienced company!
it the very close report you presented in front of the Youngsters, also Mohak if you would mention other allegation imposed on the Adani then it will be better more.
Anyway this is the really cool stuff on the present day business thing.
Please don't project him as a hero, ED Rides to acquire companies & Krishna patnam port  is the worst thing. generally ruling government support their favorable persons some what its ok, but up to what level. because of Modi ji people are not ready to question Adani atrocities.
Modi hai to Mumkin hai😂😂
*botswana

Most of his businesses are capital intensive ones. How did he get a start as it still required substantial capital infusion which he couldn’t have got from his prior businesses? Considering that he wasn’t well known to raise capital from public it is still a mystery how he managed to raise the capital

Seriously nobody is talking about hasdeo jungle
The government is corrupt . They are showing favouritsm and wasting indian taxpayers money
The last arguments iz so true it's not necessarily gonna benefits citizens as we are observing in hasdev forest case the loss is of our they will enjoy the AC but what about common people. They are getting cheap labour who said ki they are creating jobs should also know at what cost. Wage rate is so low. And price influencing is easy because unlike south korea we didn't seen any much benefits of common people. So crony capitalism has more demerits than its merits. There should be competition. THE Benefit of country is when there is multiple player and not only one or two.

I have requested to Universities to add one more subject in MBA. How to use Redtapism to your advantage. How to corrupt bureaucrats and politicians. Those who talk about honesty bla bla will always sit in the pit. Like if you agree👍
Privatisation is ok but crony capitalism is not ok.
Whatever everyone says all I can say is hard work pays off. He was just a normal business man child he is now being the biggest in the world it is something even our prime minister has done so real hard work in achieving whatever they have done for themselves.
Modi modi😂
How adani become india richest - dosti bnao bhaao aisi k zindgi badal de

Brother, I have passed 12th class. Should I start earning and building my career now? Or what should I do now? Please guide me, brother.🎉❤
Modi hai to mumkin hai
Good Video 🔥
Why have you blurred the map
To understand if Adani company is really beneficial or the alliance between the gov and Adani is really beneficial then study the Airport bidding where Adani group won all 6 ports if anyone checks the bidding price and the future plan will realise at the end, end consumer which are common people will pay a lot more for the same flights and facilities so at the end the ruling government and the company are befitting not the common man, they are literally looting ppl, you are giving your hard earned money to fuel someone else's empire.
My man called Gautam Adani a million times
Most corrupt crony capitalist. India must boycott this group and their businesses. Unfair practices and what not
when will u make videos on problems mps suspended and many more ???????

First video of ur channel....... love u brother good luck from Nepal ❤️
अदानी अदानी कर रहा है लेकिन भाई मानना तो पडेगा अदानी बहुत लोगों को रोजगार दिया है हिन्दूस्तान में इसका कोई हिसाब नहीं। कंग्रेस पार्टी राहुल घांडी(गांधी) किसको नौकरी दिया है? सिर्फ घोटाला किया है।
He looks more like Ganesh Gaitonde in the thumbnail 😂
Desh sell ho jayega ek din aisa lgta hai 😢
ED, CBI wants to know your location... You are booked under UAPA 😂😂
Remember when the BJP lost their Charm in Lok Sabha election Adani will be Next Vijay Mallaya or Nirav Modi.
It is hard work only
Mtlb paisa kamane ke liye kuch loophole dhundha hi padta h😂.

Inspiring and self made is my takeaway from this video..

Crony Capitalism, Indian version of Russian Oligarchy.
Most of the big ticket defaulters are Gujaratis.
Modi hai to mumkin hai 😆
One question, why only he becomes billionaire after 2014? Honestly, no one heard about him prior 2014.
Mohak now changed ,congratulations to be a G....Media
Nawazuddin Siddiqui se adani tak ka safar 😂
Correction “Mumbai (Maharashtra State) To Palanpur (Gujrat State) 650+ km”.
In one the answer of thumbnail is - ask modi.
Jai hind
Adani cannot be compared with Chaebols of South Korea. Adani is the enemy of our planet, not only our country. His brother Vinod is the real kingpin holding all the strings while relaxing in Burj Khalifa holding a Cyprus passport. They are Crony Capitalists and need to be stopped before Indian economy gets destroyed.
@20:14  for Mangaluru the photo shown is that of Bengaluru Vidhana Soudha. common!!!!😤😤
This is the topic we want to watch
Pahle luck fir modi ji se mitrata ka support and now 💀
The government goes hand in hand with businessmen. Money is needed to win elections and power is needed to make a monopoly business. It is a story as old as time itself.
Very well made video... Not just information but also critics and questions are very well asked regarding comparison to south korea.... We all how good is the influence of chaebol families have on common people ...  They cant even afford to raise a single child have their own a single job isnt enough to pay bills for them so they have to do extra part time job for bills ... Giving all power to a single sector was never good... No matter how it will benifit country... If it isn't benifitting common people or harming common people then is it really worth it?? Are we going to become the type of contry whose economy is one of the best but common people of that contry aren't happy... They being exploited..
there are to many informations error in your vedio for example adanis educational background
BHAI 29 ya 39  ???????????
Lowkey young adani looked like nawazuddin siddiqui 😅
Dhanji Street is not in Borivali
Modi ji ka naam nahi liya Bhai ne kahin bhi 😂
Kyuki modi hai toh mumkin hai...😅😅😅😅
Coal is needed for the smooth running of the company, so buy Coal. Government is necessary for the smooth running of the company, so buy the Government.
Hey @Sochbymm
I request you to make one video of the ARIHA case in Germany 🇩🇪 the country that separated Mother and Daughter.
Show some light on this matter and many such cases in other countries.
Ram ka nam par vote lo ,
Adani ko note do , 
Jaoo andhbhakt vote do 😂 . 
Wah! modi ji Wah .

Next one Infosys
World sees INDIA just as a market, but we dont want to be just as market , we want to be a producer too and for that we need to support the businessmen of our country . Afterall we also want someone in the country who have global influence like AMAZON, META, GOOGLE etc.
Adani was on the verge of bankruptcy in 2014. But in 2015 12k crore were written off by SBI. How did you miss this fact Mohak?

Hi Mohak Adani's Australian controversy is not mentioned in the video. Adani businesses were banned in Australia & there is a Stop Adani movement too in Australia
Well researched and presented brother
No matter what Opposition saying, we support our Billionaires. they creat millions of jobs and pay for families. they're building nation ❤
greate vido sir , specifically  details that U give!!, can U plss share some sources to research like U please sir!......
I have a doubt that Adani is the richest man in India currently?
If you have support you can make what you do with out support no one can make money
2007 adani was 13th richest person
2011 adani was 07th richest person 
Under congress 👁️👄👁️
And congress provided 73000 cr loan 🤔🤔

And recently in Karnataka adani received another deal 🤡
Yeh rishtah khy kehlahtah hai 🤔
Correction :- The Distance between Mumbai to Palanpur is 668KM not 350km.
5:04 It's spelled "Botswana" , not "Bostwana"

Interesting work. Thanks for sharing it. ✌️
very good
₹29000 Cr synthetic drug smuggling caught at Mundra port...  yet no information after that! 
₹20000 Cr overpriced coal imported with tax invasion. And Central gഠbar-heads forcing states to buy it! yet nobody has any problem with it.
That's the "success" of Adani!😏
Dear Mohak, probably you have not seen that many Springs, that Adani has dared the winters & summers.... Businesses don't run on B&W paper as you are elaborately tilting it... So stop spreading your sallow opinions in public platforms in the guise of education.
When you have friends with absolute power is the key , the rest is all we know.
Adani chor or smuggler he islea rich he..
I wasnt expecting technical guruji reporting for NDTV
1 word, Modi.
Modi hai toh mumkin hai?
taking inspiration from south korea to privilege certain corporations is a terrible idea as chaebols control MOST of the country's gdp and exports.
crime❌
innovation☑🤣.
Tata is tata, Adani pure businessman he he is not social responsible person..
Kaash apna bhi ek dost Adani ke dost jaisa ho 😂😂
Adani empire is built on base but some politician like RaGa criticise any other reason
Respect for Gautam adani
Mohak sir . Yes you are right we need national champions like samsung and Hyundai.  😊
Never vote for bjp
A well balanced take as usual.
Keep up
God forbid if we become like South Korea. It's a beautiful country as a tourist, but a hell as a citizen.

Government playing favouritism is beneficial untill the the favourites doesn't become bigger than the government. Government promoting small business are beneficial cause many small fishes run fast if you creating a Shark thinking its will not bite, its just smelling blood in opposite once he had enough blood those jaws just need one jab.

All governments help their businessmen. Apple, google, Amazon, Netflix, Tesla have gotten billions in subsidies and tax cut. When Donald trump came to india he publicly said he wants india to remove tariffs on Harley Davidson bikes. The strongest countries have the biggest businesses. Moral of the story start a good enough business where your government supports you.
His crore of loan is waived off by banks by govt. Looting people
Who all is in Adani's pocket?
With respect to Adani airport, I can only say there's still a lot more room for improvement to bring it up to par with some international airports in terms of services/efficiency.
1. For departures, after ticketing and security check, there is immigration check and the lines are long - there is no discrimination on the basis of flight time. A person with flight in 1 hour may be standing at the end of a long queue, and a person with a flight in 3 hours, could be ahead in the queue. The queues to various counters need to be organised better.

2. No free wi-fi in airports for those without local phone numbers. If you are a foreigner and try to obtain free wi-fi, it will ask to send you a code to your phone number. But your foreign phone number does not work in India, so how one will receive the code? Such formalities need to be simplified to cater to all types of passengers.
National champions can also become national villains even in south korea during economic crisis the IMF asked the government to take a stand against the monopoly that certain companies had in the country otherwise they will not  provide any support to tackle the crisis since even IMF called out south korea saying that the so called champions capitalism  are also reason for the economic crisis that they faced
Mohak, would appreciate if you are able to display a banner that clearly mentions "AD" or "ADVERT" when promoting any product.
Adani success mantra is- BJP and modi😂
US PORT PR ADANI KI DEUG PKDI GYII THII.. MEDIA SOLD OUT USPR KOI NHI BOLA
Bhaiya budget 2024 pe video plz
Election is coming aap karya karta
Can you make video on Sonia Gandhi net worth?
Adani is a selfish tenant that didn't pay his rents on time and when kt accumulated, he planned to living off by selling my property and trying to control my assets with the money he earned while living here. Like how did you get my documents, because I didn't give them to anybody or is it theft Adani commited? Can we get justice or prove it😅😂
India ko aadat hai gulami ki.. East Indian ke baad. Abb India Adani Ambani ki gulami karega.
Adani Success = Modi's corruption + Sold Media
Bhai mujhe toh ATGL and Adani green se aisa mast profit mila ki bas tab se pura full time investor ban gya... ✌👍👌
Nice info
10-20 billion to bhai ne networth me aise hi badha diye .
wikipedia me Bcomm drop out likha hai.
Thanks MM raising voice towards chattishgarh
What does Adani really do to create new wealth? Port, power, airport, trading? 
These all are businesses that facilitates other businesses.
Adani is playing the role of a government for these businesses by winning contracts as they wish.
Any other company now have to invest only with the help of Adani in those sectors. 
If you know what a gangstar is, you can relate.
As a result Indian economy is not really benefitting:
1. This differs from a free market economy. Not good for India for any foreign investment.
2. Adani is earning the revenue that a government deserves.
3. You did not mention the amount of NPA of Adani that has been cancelled by the current govt, larger than GDP of many small countries.
People like Shri Gauram Adani, Ambani family, Tata family.. and similar, are the important heroes of India… they remain in India, develop India, generate employment and develop the economy… unlike the supremely educated and super smart Indians who run away yo foreign lands and develop their economy and not India’s.
Long story short:- Mitrooon Man patronage and some intelligence..
Samsung and Hyundai Engineering aur Manufacturing Comapany hai bhai,
Adani ka konsa product khareedte hai hum log?
Kis din record hua ye video 😅
Mere dost to nalle hai warna mein bhi adani banta
Mohak Bro he started working as labour for Diamond cutting .Not In office .But his Success skies up with his Power Friends
Vah vah itna positively Apne negative ko support Kiya ha 😊
Modi is the secret of adani energy 😂
He was worth 150millon dollar when he had met me in Mombasa in 1992 or 1993. I had blessed him and said he will become top 10 richest. My blessing was suppose to be his birthday gift. He was celebrating his birthday and i had brought him sparkling wine and birthday cake. We celebrated at Nyali Beach resort. I met him through his PA.

Modi need Powerful BusinessFundinh  to Crust Congressy 💯 Adani is just the front name
Bro you really downplayed the extent of environmental damage caused and the number of poor tribals he has displaced forcefully
all indian tycoon has made their fortunes by manipulating governments only. and license raj only
Hey mohak maintain your video upload frequency... Sometimes too soon sometimes too late .. I really hate
People be supporting Adani because of his political affiliations but this guy include ambani too they are just taking india towards extreme capitalism which is very bad for our nation.
What about inflation in South Korea??
What about the full report SEBI??
Those who think Adani group is creating jobs in India I suggest you compare the number of jobs created by the Tatas and Ambanis with those by Adani. You might be surprised by the difference. Similarly, you could also look at how much these companies pay in taxes to the government. Adani pay nothing to the government if we compare it with Tata or Reliance.
Mudra port pe 9000 kg coke mila uska kya hua?
What you call Crony capitalism is capitalism bro. It's the feature of capitalism not a bug. Capital becomes so centralized in capitalism that it starts to swallow all parts of the system including gov.
Self made 🔥
Modi ji lin the corner: MITRON
One issue with port ownership.  Adani acquired ownership of the ports after 2014.  Definitely there is help from Modi/Shah govt by forcing small players to sell their ownership to Adani at discount price.

"How adani became India's richest man" 
Modi. Poltical support. Simple.
Dhanji Street borivali में नहीं है kalbadvei में है
PM's good friend from 5b$ net worth in 2014 to 91b$ in 2024 everybody knows how this happened. No one in the world has ever seen such growth of a person not even elon musk net worth rose so high in such less time.

I see so many commies in the comments section crying on business men all these years from independence under congress we were basically socialist economy why didn't we grow look at china and its large businesses how they are developing
Amit from Crazy XYZ 🤔🤔
Modi hai toh mumkin hai
Some of your facts are wrong
“Illegal in among the countries” became “Innovation” and “corrupting the politicians in 90’s” became “politicians ke saath uthna-baithna tha”.. Really?? 😅
Great work bro🎉.. Really appreciate  this hardwork.... But please can you do a research on PAST LIFE REGRESSION (A claimed medical practice like chiropathy, which claims to solve your problems by knowing your past life i.e, pichhle jananm) . Is it authentic or just another scam??.. Plz do reply... If anyone else knows then reply too

Kon manta hai Mohak sir ek acche YouTuber hai?
Yeah, If anyone have access to powerful people (you know whom I am talking about) at the right time and right place, anyone can become Adani. That is why my respect for Tata increased 1000x times !!
Not surprising what a few cronies can end up accumulating when you withhold GST from other states, and allocate projects to your home state.
Bjp k wajah se bada admi bana hai..aur din k baad desh bhi bjp Adani ko bexh dega..
Adani is no 1 chor.
Parsis, Jains, Sindhis, Pishori Punjabis Mardwaris and Gujaratis are born businessmen.
Never blame the businessman for your own failure. They are giving you jobs. If you have the guts be like them but hating them for your own failure shows you are the failure. They have got the same opportunity like you but you failed to utilize your brain.
Bhai jo bhi ho adani modi ki wjh s upar aya hai.... Jb bhi govt change hogi scams bhr ane hi hai ye fact hai
Good odoo explains
Koi bhi informative video ad ke bina bante hi nahi
In last 9 years, bjp govt waived off 14 lakh crore rupees of corporate  loans. Now, Indian common man is paying this. These corporates are growing by squeezing common man.Behind every big corporate, govt is always there and vice versa also.
No matter who helping them but he is the first generation entrepreneur jisne itni uchaa gaya hai.
Revanth Reddy laughing in the corner
When govt failed to provide me job , Adani provided me .. I m thankful for him🎉
BJP + Narendra modi = adani richnes
I think you forgot to mention that adani exponential growth came about only after 2014

*Adani saw his wealth climb 1,225% in the last ten years.* - The Hindu

I wonder😮
When modi is friend nothing to worry for adani😅
Actually, Now the situation is - rich people are growing and earning more money,
On the other hand, poor or middle are entering or entered into poverty line, 
Everyone should access everything from religion to buisness. But my some brothers and sisters they know what is religion, but they don't know anything else(maybe) i think, 
Still vote for religion.
Not for education.
Because according to BR Ambedkar, if all the citizens become educated then it will be big losses for( lotter) politicians or criminal ( both words are same- made by Indians).


Let it be, 

Still you will vote for what ur heart is asking for__________.

My words may make u feel bad 😞, i m sorry, it's my ( mojburi) .

Thanks, hope we all can understood ourselves,
We Cant even imagine how much hardwork Gautam Sir has putted in order to Establish such huge Empire
Hatters are goanna hate him but to counter them i will say to them stop using adani products and see how your life works🤠
Bro aap ke video ke beech beech me bhut ads Dene lagte hai eske bja se mind bhatak jata hai... Eska kuch karo

Hindenberg Report 😢 crying in corner
Great content mohak, as always your research and your presentation, are amazing. It's always a great thing to know the hidden fact behind things before forming an opinion. Great content❤
Biggest Indian looter (capitalists) is Adani.
Only some people can understand my words. WORDS ARE VERY SIMPLE don't make it difficult.
You make amazing videos... But quality of research is going down... constructive criticism ... admire your work... dont want quality to go down
How sad people criticised those who r working for the country.Nothimg is free here, if adani  worked hard he will get what he deserve.
Adani to ab news me bhi nhi hai😒
hey mohak you should talk about maratha reservation in maharashtra......
Name one politician or business house in India that is not connected to politician and/or political party in India. Literally all are connected, and YES, that includes TATA as well. TATA too is known to give election funds to political parties. All this theatrics, virtue signaling  and brouhaha by opposition is only because they are getting less funds compared to BJP.  Ever wondered why Mr. Rahul Gandhi has suddenly gone silent on Ambani for the past 2-3 years?
Without modiji he is nothing..
Dhanji street is not in Borivali.. Its in Kalbadevi area Mumbai
I can say that if if any of us had a friend who becomes PM aren't we gonna take some benefit from him. 
Why not be serious man talking morality on SM is not ground reality. 
Also Ambani is also dragged in such cases 
That family has been richest since INDIRAJI's time, 
Stop hate for buisness, everyone cannot get government jobs, neither should government involve in buisness 
Yes crony capitalist practice is bad but we have clearly seen Revanth Reddy with Adani giving him contacts.
Make a video on Birla Group of Industry and Mahindra Group of Industry. Those who want this topic,like this comment

If he is earning foreign currency and providing jobs then I have no problem with it. I will support anyone who does that.
Had SEBI been even a bit concerned about retail players protection in the stock market, then it would not have closed its social media account. SEBI knows that if it remains on Twitter, then clients(ordinary investors) will flood its twiiter accounts with complaints daily. So, NEVER Trust SEBI which is fooling public only ?
amazing! so well explained mohak!
Agar Modi nahi rahto adani dub jayega or dhuwa waha se nikal ta hai ja aag lagi ho adani company me kuch to problem hogi jo itne log ishpe allegation laga rahe hai
He achive more than pakistan gdp
Nice content. This inspired me alot. Thanks for making this valuable video.
Isliye kahate hai dosht or dushman soch samaj ke banane chaiye😅😂😂
South Korea is not a very good example as both Hyundai Group and Samsung Group control a lot of political climate in the country,even bribing the PM (the stories are endless) ,it is due to the fact that the government always had strong ties with the owners and leaders of these companies.
Like when Hyundai was utterly failing in their construction business,but the government pushed it by providing contracts in the US.

US in itself is a pure capitalistic country with huge conglomerates control so much in the political system,that includes conpanies in defence (Lockheed Martin,Raytheon,Boeing etc.),Monsanto,Kargil, Petroleum companies (Exxon Mobil,Shell etc.,the horrors that these companies in Africa are unimaginable).

It's good that any person from the very ground level can reach to such heights through his hardwork and talent,and it the need of the hour for India to have these kind of people to help in its development. 
But we have to be aware that these very people for their profits should not exploit the common people of the country.
Everything needs to be regulated and always watched over for any shortcomings(this is just an ideal case, nothing like this will ever happen).

This topic has a lot of nuances and thin lines of ,what is right for the business or for the common people.
kya karogey itne pese ka.. jab nature hi nahi bachegaa
Indian gov. ko par monopoly nahi honi chaiye ishpe diyan dena chiye kyu ki koi bhi kam me kishi ki monopoly hona ye khatarnak ho sakhta hai😐
Nice case study❤❤

Hey.. why talk his life. .. Forget it.. Just.. Like. . subscribe. And money
Sarkari  bank  se  loan  le  lo  hajaro  carodo  main  fir  sarkar  se  loan maafi  le  lo  aur  bade  business men  ban  jao  ? Mangal  sahab  ye  batate  ki  adani  group ne  sarkari  banko  se kitna  loan  liya  aur  kitna  loan  maaf  kara  liya  sarkar  se  ? Ye  sara paisa  janta  ke  tax  ka  hai  jo  indirect 63%  ke  upper  har  nagrik  par  lagta  hai  ?
Inko dekh ke koi Aaj ke jamane me ports se business start kar sakta he kya?? When it is fully Dominated by Adani...?
As per the database of billionairer's
38% are gujrati & Parsi
12% marwadi
19% Maharashtrians
9.5 % from TN & Kerala 
5%   marathi's 
& rest of the billionairer's are from all over the parts of India 
& marathi's list is seperated , becz they admire himself as marathi just like gujrati billionaires
That's why I'm not included those marathi's in the Maharashtra list 
& List is based on languages, cast & state wise , so don't comment me , mumbai & delhi have 80% billionaires 👍🏻
80% of indian gdp depends on corporate comapnies. What happenes their stock value plummets?
Not good for India such people.. killing competition and innovation if one business has monopoly
adani to desh chala raha hai...feku to photo padane me busy hai
The answer is Modi
14:02 editor bhai
Why are you blurring many parts of this video?
Isme puchna kya sabko pata hain how he became richest 😂
Adani is amazing ❤
Justifying malpractice
Why your channel subscribers are not growing with speed as other channels are growing 😢
It is very disappointing. People are not interested in such informative videos instead they are much more interested in content which is not good, cringed, unwanted, roasting
Rahul Gandhi ke darhi se mujhe as a men yuk feel ho raha hai please shave bhai 😢
Jaise samusang monopoly waise hi adani hai
You should have pointed out how its actually not that good, south korea lives with samsung. Samsung can live without south korea but south Korea can't and this type of dependency is already a problem to south korea and if nothing is done, soon be a problem to india as well. Though i hope so india will more likely end like china or japan rather than south korea
If someone says that Adani has only worked smart, then it is not completely true, whereas Adani's luck was also good that he got a good solution to every problem.
but adani who find every solution with next business with his great intelligence.👍👍
Bhaiya Gujarat me e sab kuchh mumkin hai 😍,, business krna hai to aa jaye ,, sab log ,,

Tata , ambani, birla they all got the business inheritance they had a base but adani build everything on his own from being a common man to the richest man
Video is gud bt side effects of adani.
Gujrat electric board 4 rs per unit deti thi. Ar adani 8 rs per unit. Nd adani force fully shut down state electric board by political mili bhagat in some areas
Jab jeb mei ho sarkar, koi muskil badi nhi mere yaar.
Correction around 13:27. The positiom marked for Mundra port on the map is entirely wrong. It's in Gulf of Kutch and not Gulf of Khambat.
Modani destroy small businesses
Everything is okay but trees are more important save hasdev please
Why the BLUR?
Mundra shown in map is at incorrect location in video.
Moral of the story: Make friends wisely😂
simple. called crony capitalism
Modi best friend
Modi hai to Mumkin hai 😅

I love this man... Selfmade billionaire... Doing most complex projects like power, ports beacuse of that now india is surplus in power...and gettinv 24 *7power supply.
India should have 50 Adanis and Ambanis instead of just 2.
Location of Mundra and Kandla port is not accurate many times in this video
I love ur videos.. Can u make a video on Ratan Tata ji?? Actually he is the most honest ,kind hearted and simplest man..

Jai Hind 🇮🇳🇮🇳🙏🙏.
I am from palanpur😮
Sir I live in Palanpur
One correction: Adani purchased Ambuja and ACC before Hidenburg incident , not after
Please make a video on the recession in IT Sector 2024.
Ye tho dhoti khol raha hai😂
Because he is a jain❤
A Chiwala can be PM, by Adani and so do a small businessman will be billionaire by Modi, why not?
Loot
Coming together is beginning 
Keeping together is progress 
Working together is success 
Modiji and adaniji thank you ❤
Adani in the thumbnail looks like a younger brother of subrahmanyam Jaishankar, our EAM 😂
I couldn't understand why Adani had to import coal from outside India when in India we have the largest coal producer as Coal India?
Because of MODANI 😂😂😅
India need many many more business mans and powerful innovative companies to make more jobs in India, shitty failed socialism is a parasite

Adani 🤝 modi 🤑
We all know how adani became rich 🪷
The sad part is when such crucial strategic assets gets into the hands of an Indian, many Indian are against him, they would rather prefer a Chinese or American company than an Adani or Tata. We don't have trust even between ourselves, the mentality of "if we are not ahead, we wouldn't let our people get ahead" is extremely harmful, but Americans, Japanese and Chineses don't have such thinking, they have unity, networking, domestic cooperation and are very nationalistic, we need to learn to have such characteristics. Success should be contagious just like it is in America. Others should learn from successful people and we need to be trustful, do networking and have good supportive helping business environment, because this is how Americans are so ahead and that's why Indians, Chinese suddenly acquire success in America and start shining there
mohak bhai tumhare pass adani ka past hai hi uski stragl ko chiting batta dena is it not good bro
Bhai to Revanth Reddy kyu kar Raha bussiness aur Gehlot ne bhi Kiya bussiness kya unhone bhi paise khaye the
Why do you sound like you are just Normalising his dirty work by saying "yee tho koi nai baat nhi he .... Sab asa karte hai " 😢
Adani is pulling the biggest cons in corporate history.
Bro your content 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
Modi hai toh mumkin hai
Is se jada rupya ka to mai chips kha gaya 

Kisi ko paisa chahiye to mujhse mang le
Modi made him richer from taxpayers money
Modani मोडानी.
Adani has no impact on Indian economy. He only gathered riches for himself. Because we saw Jio wave not improvement in airport service.
Modi hai to mumkin hai guys! I respect Mukesh Ambani anyday more than this Adani’ without the govt backing he is nothing 💯
All the companies allegated by hindenberg....
Have crashed....
But Adani s downfall occured for short period and then it grew tremendously.......which shows the transparency

Power of Adani....... 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🤘🤘🤠🤠
ये सब तो ठीक है but 3000 ऐकर जमीन gov ने free में ही देदी।
No problem adani being backed by Govt...i mean har family mai strong log hone chahiye...
Problem is...adani is not in the top employers of India...
To mtlb thode logo ka tel nikal ke hi rich bn gye
साम दाम दंड भेद
Abki baar Adani Sarkar

there are some aspects of the story which u have ignored completely
You mentioned SK's strategy of chaebols but didnt mention that this strategy tanked the SK economy and is the reason of extremely high wealth inequality.

This proves that Congress😅 allegations on Adani group and Modi ji are incorrect😊😊....
Modi h to mumkin h😂
aur asani drugs ka dhandha karta h
Jai adani! Jai modi! Har har modi, ghar ghar modi!
adani ka share ka rate 80% over values h  , kyuki uspar modi ka haath h jisne desh ki puru property usko de di , market me competitions nhi h
Mtlb agr desh ka sbse amir admi bn na hai toh aane wale politician se dosti krlo😂😂
FRAUD😂
Adani would not be the richest if Tata did not donate so much
Adani stood his ground when Hindenburg went after him. Hindenburg was supported by American Billionaires and American Government. Instead of Adani selling his company or selling Adani properties to cash his money and escape to Britain like Lalit Modi, he stood his group and fought against Hindenburg that has a history of bankrupting companies. No company has ever survived against Hindenburg. Adani fought against Hindenburg and did whatever he could in his power to dilute his stocks, make investors aware the worth of his companies and properties, and he published his Profit/ Loss (watch Aap ki adalat). This goes to show that when an empire is  built by your own hands then a man will do anything for the empire and die fighting the battle. Let's take Maharana Pratap as an example who fought against Akhbar. Adani has put in a lot of work and effort in Adani Groups and he fought an uphill battle when American/ European media was extensively covering Hindenburg report. At the end- he came victorious. This is a story of One man and One company against America and European Nations.
New Indian Lord😅😅😅😅
Correction Mundra port in not in Bhavnagar it's in kachch

You must concentrate on the topic that he bought the media  also so the government also under control so we are getting rulled by a rich person not by a government 😂😂
Honestly, I was tired after work and didn't wanna hear any info but I was too curious and I love how you explain stuff, so I watched it🎉 What a nice way to chill❤
What is his stance on taxpayers' status?
Rahul is always right ✅️

A successful business, neither friend nor enemy with anyone.
quint is one of the most critic of bjp govt. Which is owned by adani.gmr,bajaj, reliance is also friendly with congress.
correction 11:18 both mundra and kandla port location are wrong
Jab aapka naukar country ka PM bn jaye to kyo nhi banega koi sabse rich..Desh k tijori khol k rakh diya he adani k liye. Sare desh k resource baat diye.
Also understand... That these big guys .. including CEOs of GL, Apl, MS have powerful PR who are hired to keep painting them in Good light.
सैया भयो सरकार तो डर काहे का
China was aggressively bidding for the Israeli port. But at the end, they lost. No wonder they were frustrated by Adani's. Look at the timing of the Indian bug report. It comes just when he was in Israel I think many people do not realise this
Good video keep it up Bro..
Biggest scam of India - Adani's Wealth
You know what the funny part about gujjus dominating business is? 
the casteism is very low in gujarat. You will find businessman on every corner of the street. And the left cant tolerate that what else will they criticize? Coz its not like only brahmins are doing business. I am a patel and we do a lot of business too. So then they have issues when other skills like networking are used. Grown up guys, a lot of people use networking and it happens even in USA.

yes adani dominating is bad. capitalism needs competition. thats the bad part. not networking.
14:02 Mistake hai yaha. 39 likha aur tumne 29 kaha hai.
His Friend is Mr.
Mohak, since a long time user, I thought to come this mistake under your notice at 11:16, wrongly showing locations of Kandala and Mundra port on Google Earth.
Hope to see an improvement ahead.
Modi ji be like : ess sajan ko kya taklif ha
Thanks for itna Sara likes🤣🤣✌️
11:19 The location of mundra port is extremely wrong please do propper research 😢
Your voice are very soft😍😍
Adani playing Sim City  IRL
There is one more word OLIGARCHY
He achieved it through modi. Adani is the front man of modi.  He basically helps modi make money and invests heavily to control media, buy mps, and influence other spheres of indian society through money. In return, modi gives all the govt contracts, licences and projects to him.
11:18 Location of Kandla and Mundra Port it not correct
i live in borivali there is no dhanji street here its in south mumbai borivali is north mumbai .
Jab desh ka pradhanmantri dost ho toh kya kuch nahi ho sakta

My adani looks exactly like my maths teacher !!
Elon Musk is the real billionaire  the torch bearer of our time
Colonial type of Adani’s electric power grid deal with Bangladesh 
Will make Bangladesh and Indian friendship stronger than steel and probably won't create hostility among Bangladeshis against  Indian 😅😅
Modi hai toh mumkin hai
He became richest man because of the current government and the ruling dispensation
I know nobody cares but people in chhattisgarh are still protesting for saving the hasdeo forest.
Soorryyyy

Congress losing in Chhattisgarh even after strong opinion poll in their favour can't be a coincidence. Especially when there are questions being raised on EVM.
Sponsored video 😂
Young Adani Is looking like Nawazuddin Siddiqui 😁
13:23 Same wrong Location of Mundra Port Please correct it
"Adani Group Ek Strategic Asset Ban Chuki Hai" isiliye Uske Aur Uske Priya Mitra Ke Kiye Huye Dhandhlio Ko Agar Koi Dikhaye To Uske Upar India Ke Puri Agency O Ko Laga Diya Jata Hai Jaise Wo Khud India Ke Malik Ho😢😢😢.
Adani = Financial wing of BJP
1:47 DHANJI MENTIONED 🗣️💯💯

11:19 Wrong location of Kandla and Mundra Port
Bro you wrong describe kandla and Mundra port location ....🙃🙃
PAPER MONEY is the biggest SCAM in the world .....
Bro used only 1% of is gujrati spirit 🗿
Adani stocks wentup like crazy after 2014❤❤..
My best investment.. whatever u may say.. but I've never seen any stocks shooting up that crazy.😂😂

MEANWHILE INDIANS ASPIRE TO BECOME CYBER CEO SEPOY IN AMERICAN COMPANY
Motivational videos dekha kro , aap bhi rich ho jaoge .
So you are telling that violation of import rules is a innovation?!! 😂 How much nonsense a human could be!! 😂 You should learn on what you spread to people. 

GSEC violated important rules with influence of adani which is even illegal in India but you are telling this the way seems like nothing happened!!
Modi knows that better than Adani himself😅
How wrong the location of Kandla Port and Mundra Port was here!😂
Is it just me that sees that this story is similar to that of dhirubhai ambani
He also exploited government laws by making license
Simple, with the help of politicians
Lodoo😅😂😂
Adani ✨🏆
Gautam Adani comes from Jain community and Jain community is a minority in India.

Kon kon Mohak Mangal ko pasand karte hai ❤❤❤
Ye adani ki sakal mere father ke sakal se q milti h 🤔🤔🤔mere father ki ak he photo ab wo nhi rhe ...hamsakal lag rha h dono photo 😂😂😂
21:26 *Kerala* *Government* was intially  against handing over of *Thiruvananthapuram* *International* *Airport* & and as a part of it they gave tender study to a company , 😂 which is run by Adani s' daughter in law . Kerala Government is run by CPIM not BJP so you can understand the range of Adani s' hands.
So basically, Adani wants to buy all sea ports and air ports to create a monopoly. 🤔
 No one family should control all businesses. 

Asli *Vikas* toh *Adani* ka hua hai..
हमारे देश की कंडीशन ये है अगर आपको छोटे शहर में भी कोई ठेका लेना है  तो नेताओं से अच्छे संबंध होने ही चाहिए। जो लोग नही करते वो सिस्टम को कोसते रहते है और पीछे रह जाते है
So  here u says all allegations to adani and Modi r false 😅😅

The purpose of the video is 2024 elections 😢😂
Adani❤
It's not Adani, its Modani 💀
All thanks to MODI
Rahul Gandhi says Modi ji give projects to Adani meanwhile Ashok Gehlot, Bhupesh Baghel and Revanth Reddy
Kedi ji: 
*smiling from the corner 😂
I'll save your time.
Summary of complete video = MODI
The major problem of our country is that we don't want to see a indian with such a wealth ..... Congress always accuse adani with corruption despite he is one of the biggest asset to india
When you have modi anything is possible😂
Power of friendship
well family also comes into play.. the gujarti family is very supportive along with relatives so that's why gujarities success rate is high in business.. if you say to your father that i want to open business.. your father and family will go in depression first and ask you to focus on work and stop dreaming..
He is my inspiration tbh, for whatever people say.
Modi hai to sab mumkin hai 😅😅😅
The total capacity of Indian ports currently stands at 2,604.99 mtpa. All Adani ports combine to contribute about 339 mtpa. Only the Mundra port is significant (it contributes about 150 of the 339 mtpa). The other 11-12 ports owned/operated by Adani are much smaller contributing less than 35 mtpa each.

While I give Adani a lot of credit for his entrepreneurship, to ignore that his growth has not been aided by his proximity to the current PM only leads us to question the authenticity of your channel.
You did not mentioned that supreme court dismissed hindenberg case against adani due to lack of evidence
As always in depth analysis, keep it up 🎉
modi hai to mumkin hai
Thank you for such amazing analysis .Much Needed.
How? Modi ki kripa se
Are vah Mundra nahin hai Bhavnagar 😂😂😂
Trip par gya or vaha modi kaa thela tha vaha modi ko gas chahiye thi ....chai bnani thi....adani ne use gas lake di or modi ne promise kiya ki jab vo pm banega toh sare contract use dega
Vinod Adani stays in dubai and is one of the richest NRI
All thanks to feku ji😂
He is true entrepreneur
*Modani* ji ki kripa hai
Political hand is needed for this type of success.
Chalo Borivali ko mention Kiya
Adani Ports and SEZ Stock after this video 📈📈↗️
Gautam Adani pride of India 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Save 'Hasdev' jungle bcoz nature never forgive.
Mehnat...Mehnat...Mehnat...🤣🤣🤣
अरे भाई लोग मोहक कहना चाहता है इस बार खानग्रेस और खांसीवाल चोर को वोट दें।
Congress talks about Ambani and Adani but they forget about Robert Vadra and DLF?
Congress in Media : Modi is giving favors to Adani and Ambani.

Congress state governments : Adani and Ambani come and invest in our states.
Hating rich people for no reason has become a trend nowadays🙂
Your starting is wrong bhai
Gujratis is back bone of India ❤❤ tata Adani Ambani etc
Lol, 9:30, doing illegal things is not innovation 😶
Lot's of people in the comment section crying " Modi helped him" describes their crab mentality . 😂😂

rather than crying learn how he made it . And why modi helped only him is also a skill. And No business can work properly with govt help.
Adani Ports and SEZ Stock after this video 📈📈↗️
Adani Contribution in Indian Infrastructure is Immense and it has become strategic that's why Chines AgenT Pappu Always Target him to Weaken India
Stock manipulation and friendship with prime minister
Don’t accuse Adani without knowing his contributions to the country. Criticise him once you reached to his level….
I am wondering what kind of kid goes to beach and think he will create a bigger port 😂
Adani gives me Jethalal vibe
Finally kisi ne to hasdeo ki baat ki 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Best video keep it up sir
The problem is he is just winning contracts most of his businesses are not that profitable and he cannot export like samsung and hyundai. Both samsung and hyundai can export and help south korea because they had the upper hand in technology, what adani is doing is just taking over government businesses and not making anything innovative that will make them an export powerhouse. If they will invest in research and development to create signature products then it can be compared to samsung.
"Guided Capitalism" doesn't always succeed. Please remember USA's multiple economic crises over the years.
Bro next pakistan debt
Government ka dia hua din hei bhai 😂😂😂
My name is gautam😂 I have 43₹
Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka & Tamilnadu have highest numbers of billionaires+millionaires, on the other side Bihar, UP & Rajasthan have most IAS officers.
Conclusion:- Billionaires are more important than the Government Offices for any state.
and some kongress lovers saying adani grown because of modi 😂😂
Modi ji be like - mujhe credit nahi chahiye 🤗😂
Adani groups biggest Advantage is creation of Sense of Security of Contract and Basic stable environment, this type of Companies arise in Developing countries due to low private confidence not because of corruption, where as there are multiple opportunistic corrupt practices used by Adani group most of their business development is due to the above mentioned reason.
Isn't 1 billion 100 crores then how it becomes 7 lakh crores can anyone please explain
His 3rd turning point is when modi ji became PM. Its good as long as he is not a crony capitalist and work for progress of the country.
Plz make a video on birla group..
Politician are the backbone of the businesses............
Simple short and realistic answer would be by befriending with Modi
Bubble going to burst soon

Modi ji ki Krupa se 😂😂😂
Adani success formula :- intelligence + hand of powerful friends = no competition.
One correction: at somewhere around 11:15, Kandla and Mundra port are shown on Gujarat map. They are shown on the shore of "Kathiawad" peninsula in Gujarat in this video. In reality, they are situated in the district of Kachchh (northwest part of Gujarat bordering with Pakistan).

Same error at 13:23

@sochbymm
Tumbhi kr skte ho bhai jab sarkar ka hath ho banks loan de denge sare contract apko milenge to fir aap bhi ban jaoge asli richest person Tata Aur Ambani hai adani nhi
Bohot bora laga soch ne apna thinking ko bayas dikhaya, jab congress ne adani ko help kiya tab a karna desh or Gujrat ke liye jaruri tha, jitna bjp ne kiya o bohot galat tha desh ke liye. Ek company itna favor korna baki businessman ko bohot loss jhelna pora.

Congress thi isliye ye success ho paya,ek normal businesmen  sustain kar payalekin modi ji ne isse monopolistic bana diya ,sara competition khatam shayad hi ab koi naya adani bane.
Back then Adani looked like Nawaz
Business should thrive in india.. but GOVT should take allegations seriously also.. because favouritism kills the competition... It harms the real talent.. it's always better to have 10 companies competing among them than one company monopoly..

Edit: I don't think just giving projects to a company is favouritism...it turns bad when govt changes rules just to benifit a particular company. 
Obviously we know the the story of NDTV. (How the monkey is used to control media)
Friend with benefits
Adani has been a brilliant businessman. No doubt about it. I actually have no problems with his cronyism. It is the politicians who irk me for their fake righteousness and  image management.
Ma bhi kardo comment
Modi h toh kya kuch nahi hoskta is proved by this share market manipulator😂😂
politicians k binaa koi bhi businessman badaa nahi ho saktaa....
The video’s title should be ‘How Modi made his fellow Gujarati the richest man of India’ 😂😂😂
I just loose intrest in motivational videos and  knowing about billionaire wealth 
😩😩
Because these things are not presented as it is
Mudi ji: mujhe credit ni chaiye
i will be the next richest mark my words
With support of the ruling government 🔥
People are forgetting that in past a company had come here and looted us.  This company had made our country so poor.  Our people died of hunger.  Now again, do we want such a situation? We should not hand over our country to anyone under the influence of patriotism.

SEBI itself is in bed with Adani
And don't compare Adani with Samsung and Hyundai
South Korean companies used all that money to develop new tech and export it all over the world
Adani just pockets the profits and gives nothing back to the country
Main chahta hun ki modi ji 150 years tak jiye taki unki successful mission ko woh dekh sake aur sath sath unse ho rohi galtiyan aur hatya e and sari attyachar jo unhone musalmano per kiya woh sab woh mehsus kar sake aur main ek baat batadu musalman logo se Mera koi jyada lagab nahi bas Daya hai kyun ki mein ek acha hindu hun dharm ne bahut  paap mukt nahi hai
13:53 congress does nothing to control adani, now crying on adani wtf😂
Mohak sir padh le comment hamare liye yahi bahut h
Sarkar kali adani nu he fayidaa de rahi a kise hor company nu kyu nai mohak bhai agar fayida he dena hai tu sabhi kuuu duuuu g
24:40 investors adani ji nhi modi ji leke aaye unke liye 🤣🤣 sabko pata hai
Muje like nahi chayihe bhaiyo 
Bas Ram Ram Bol do 🙏
South Korea is actually an example of how there should not be national champions, while in South Korea these companies are most of the GDP they bully those less fortunate and get away with it and there is lack of innovation coz these companies will make sure to destroy any upcoming competition and will also further make wealth gap a problem coz the only ones that are winning are the companies not citizens
Hello. At 11:18, you displayed Mundra Port and Kandla Port near the Gulf of Khambhat when they are situated in the Gulf of Kutch. Additionally, there were several times you mispronounced the "Kandla" port. The correct pronunciation is कंडला. Kindly address these errors.
missing = 'background music'
1985: Rajiv Gandhi helped
1995: Manmohan Singh helped
2019: "adani hatao desh bachao" - congress
Why before elections?Tell about the riches of jhrkhnd CM too
Dalali karke aur gareebo ki zameen hadapke
Every gujrati be like
Ambani was owning NDTV before adani ji
bro the background music is just very cool
what a crazy coincidence, i was searching for your video on adani last night and u post about him today.
what a coincidence mann , crazyy!!
Kuch log bahut jaldi comment karte hai taki unhe like mile had hai yaar😂😂
I watched all of your videoes but now i  noticed that you have been more into promoting adani after the hindenburg disaster last year. It’s better to discuss about something that directly represents india as a country. Proud to be indian
Condition- Must be DNA 420
26:31 wrong Hindutva sarkar sab ko champion banana chati hai isliye  it is doing so much for small businesses. Adani and Tatas are the in the forefront of opening business as per govt ka strategy hence they are getting pampered.
Bhaiya indirectly Ratan Tata Sir is  the richest person ❤❤
Where is the English subtitles bro...
Hi mohak, please create series of Indian entrepreneur stories and their businesses.
We all know how.

Desh ka actual PM yeh hai
Everyone knows how adani became the 3rd richest person in just 3yrs with the help of most corrupted govt(modani)!!!
Modi to Adani : dosti bani rahe
Modi hai to mumkin hai
Mundra and kandla port's location on map is wrong
Tale of a great friendship .
Free ke zameen mil jae, policies desh ki usse puch ke banayi jaegi to koi bhi ban jaega😂.. sach bolo bhai video me  .. khul ke
मोदीजी laughing comment section
One correction at 2:00 : the road distance from Palanpur to Mumbai is about 670 km, not 350 km. Additionally, the aerial distance between these two locations is approximately 570 km.
Election is coming and he targeting bjp 😂😂

Typical left thinking providing data targets and all people can agree and hate modi and adani

Seriously I don't have problem with targeting we need this type of people who target government also 😜😜

And I'm just simple voter of bjp and political analyst 😂😂

I love how mohak manipulate with DATA 😂 
Good mohak keep it up 

Aur jisake jhut lag raha he isake last videos deko😂😂
India really is a country of contrasts...you'll see some of the richest people on planet living only a walkable distance away from the most poor, malnourished people youve ever seen in life. Any country with a civilized populace will not tolerate such stuff and set out to do the right things so that the top 10% dont eat up all that the remaining 90% NEEDS. Sorry to say, us Indians arent the latter
Keep it up
Bro you have made a video on Gandhi's problem can you make a video on Savarkar ideology his pros and cons
Congress se achi payment mil gayi hai lagta hai...
Small correction : Dhanji Street is in Kalbadevi near Colaba in South Bombay and not Borivali as mentioned in video which is almost North Western border of Mumbai
Waste video.
Next video on Manish Sisodiya please ❤❤❤
By being a good friend of Modi ji, Mr. adani has achieved this
मोदी ने जनता के tax के Institutions अदानी के जेब मे डाल दिये. मोदी full time Unregistered Employee हैं अदानी का 😡
His wealth increased by more than 1000% within a few years. 
Does he have any cutting edge technology  like tesla ,tsmc ???  No ??? 
Does he have  control over raw material supply chain ?? 
Did he win lottery of 10 lakh crore ?  No !?? 
 Its clear than there is a god father 😅 behind him.
A part of  wealth are paper money , bloated and nothing else.
When the ruling party changes ,he will be another vijaya mallaya or anil ambani
This is india where under every tree you will get a person lecturing about moral and ethical  code of conduct but will cheat you for a few buck.
Next topic "why indians are marrying foreigners are increasing"
11:16  bhai locations galat hai kandla port aur mundra port ki 🙄
How much did they pay you?
Kandla and Mundra location is incorrect
Your pronunciation of the port "Kandla" is not correct. It is "कंडला". At least, we Gujjus pronounce it that way.
I invested 5 lac in adani
Thanks for telling us about Odoo.
कुल मिलाकर इससे ये पता चला कि ऐसा नहीं है की अदानी 2014 के बाद आया, दरअसल अदानी 2014 से पहले ही बहुत बड़ा empire खड़ा कर चुका था।।

Rich BCCI should help our Indian🇮🇳 Football⚽🏆, Hockey🏒 team💯❤ for✨🔥 better performance
Just watched the incredible video on Gautam Adani's journey to becoming one of the world's wealthiest individuals by Soch By Mohak Mangal. Your ability to weave together his story with such clarity and depth is truly remarkable. Your content not only educates but also inspires viewers to dream big and work hard. Keep enlightening us with more such stories. Your channel is a treasure trove for anyone keen on understanding the intricacies behind the success of luminaries like Adani. Looking forward to more enlightening videos!
Jujjus and business go hand in hand
Paytm pe 150₹ prapt hua 😂😂😂😂
Get ready bro for CBI to the open door  😂
Drug dealer hai adani
He has his own PM
We should change our mentality, industrialists are always not thieves, they are nation builders too.
The more millionaire/billionaires we will have, the more our country will prosper as a whole
Why He is looking like S jayshankar sir 😂

Love your videos! Keep it up! 👍 
However I would like to point out that the audio quality in your videos is not that great
😊 hope you take this in a good way
Lol People who cant pass their degree are commenting modi - adani 😂

Having super wealthy people doesn't make a country great.But maybe equal distribution of wealth does.

@Thinkforhumanity
Modi de karaan
Most People are proud that sunder picchai, satya nadella, rushi sunak etc are Indians but actually we should be proud of adani, mukesh, tata, because they create jobs here, pay tax here, develop India ❤❤❤
I also Start a small garment store but now my turnover is around 5 crore.
"Modi hai to Adani hai"...😂
modi h to mumkin h 😂
"When the rich rob the poor, it's called business.

India pvt ltd with liabilities to other citizens.... a X-ani Company
"People accuse Adani of employing questionable tactics to increase his wealth, such as leveraging politicians and engaging in fake valuations. However, they tend to overlook that his success is rooted in his intelligence. If you have an issue with his achievements, why not strive for similar success and become the world's richest? It's not as simple as it may seem."
The locations at 11:00 of mundra and kandla are wrong
Jo mere comment like krega vo Dil se bhut achha insan h❤❤
Still No 2 is more powerful then No 1 😂😂😂
You didnt mention what nawazuddin siddique is doing in your thumbnail😂
Russia is run by Oligarchs. 
But unlike Russia, India is dominated by only 2 oligarch. 
It's Dangerous for Average citizens.
It's Russian oligarchy but on steriods
Modi hi adani hai jaise gangadhar hi shaktiman hai
Jo abhi tak nahi samjha ram unhe buddhi de

Moral - Make friends wisely😂😂
Why didn't anyone took any legal action against adani after the hindenburg report???
Gautam ki present time Success ke peeche PM modi hain jinhone unke liye bahut kuch kiya. 

At most 6 Airports dene ka breech todkar Adani group ko aur jyada Airports diye gye...

Aur bhi bahut kuch.
